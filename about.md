I am a researcher in computer science and applied mathematics. I received a Ph.D. from Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore in 2013, carrying out research on theoretical problems in random graphs and mean-field optimizations.

Currently, I am working as a freelancer solving challenging problems in machine learning and computer vision. I maintain an interest in all artificial intelligence technologies. I develop solutions using Python and Java, working with OpenCV, numpy, and scipy. I am interested in learning TensorFlow and using it soon for some interesting projects.
